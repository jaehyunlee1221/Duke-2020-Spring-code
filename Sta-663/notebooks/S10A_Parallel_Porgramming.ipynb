    "- Message Passing Interface (MPI). Framework for parallelism based on message passing on a compute cluster. Often used when parallel processes need to frequently communicate with each other. More common in scientific than data analysis applications.\n",
    "- GPU computing (CUDA, OpenCL). Framework for exploiting the massively parallel but basic compute units available in modern GPUs. Ideal when you need a large number of simple arithmetic function calls - for example, in deep learning. The [CuPy](https://cupy.chainer.org) library looks like a promising GPU-accelerated alternative to `numpy` if you have a modern NVidia GPU.\n",

    "## Basic Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "### Concurrent, parallel, distributed\n",
    "\n",
    "- Concurrent programs have tasks with overlapping lifetimes, and concurrent programming is based on units of execution that can be run in any order with the same final result. Concurrent programs can but need not be executed in parallel - for example, the time-slicing performed by the Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL), which only allows one thread to be physically executed at any point in time, is an example of concurrency.\n",
    "- Parallel programs run at the same time, for example, on multiple cores. If there is no need to control access to shared resources, these are known as *embarrassingly parallel* programs. All parallel programs are thus concurrent, but not vice versa.\n",
    "- Distributed programs run over multiple computers. The term is most often associated with \"Big Data\" problems, where data transfer is the computing bottleneck - hence the philosophy of \"bring the computation to the data\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### Synchronous and asynchronous calls\n",
    "\n",
    "When there is concurrent access to a shared resource, errors can arise. For example, consider the following code executed by two concurrent processes which share the variable `i` with an initial value of 0:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    " i = i + 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The following may happen: Process 1 reads (`i = 0`), Process 2 reads (`i = 0)`, Process 1 updates (`i = 1`), Process 2 overwrites the value put in by Process 1 (`i = 1`). Hence, after two updates, the value of `i` is 1 and not 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid this problem, the first process to access the resource may *lock* it for exclusive access:\n",
    "\n",
    "Process 1 reads and locks (`i = 0`), Process 2 tries to access `i` but it is locked, Process 1 updates and releases lock (`i = 1`), Process 2 now reads and locks (`i = 1`), and updates and unlocks (`i = 2`). Hence, after two updates, the value of `i` is 2 as it should be. Note that because the processes are *synchronous*, each process *blocks* access to the shared resource, forcing other process to wait - in Python, this waiting manifests as lack of access to the interpreter until the computation is complete.  In this context, *synchronous* and *blocking* have the same meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Asynchronous* or *non-blocking* calls were designed to allow access to the interpreter at all times - an asynchronous function call returns control to the interpreter immediately, and returns a *future* object that can be used to check at a later point in time if the computation is completed and if so, to return the answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Concurrency is difficult\n",
    "\n",
    "Designing programs that share resources or have other dependencies to run concurrently in an effective way is challenging. One of the main reasons for the increasing popularity of functional programming is that concurrency is generally easier with a functional programming style - for example, the famous map-reduce framework for distributed computing uses the `map` and `reduce` abstractions of functional programming.\n",

    "\n",
    "In the example below, up to 4 processes may be trying to increment and assign a new value to val at the same time. Because this takes two steps (increment the RHS, assign to LHS), it can happen that two or more processes increment at the same time, but this is only assigned and counted once."

    "Ahmdahl recognized that the degree of speed-up is driven by the ratio of serial to parallelziable code segments. Serial parts are those where the order is essential $a \\to b \\to c$. Suppose the serial section of code takes up 10% of the the total run-time. Then the maximum speed up 10-fold - the serial part takes up 10% of the time, and you throw one million minus one cores at the parallelizable parts driving their execution time towards zero, giving the 10-fold speed up.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gustafson pointed out that as the size of the problem increases, the time spent in  serial code segments typically goes down. For example, MCMC is inherently *all* serial, but for very large data sets, within each MCMC step, there is typically a need to calculate the likelihood of each data point, and this can be parallelized. We used this idea to achieve over two orders of magnitude speed up for fitting statistical mixture models using GPU computing."

Because of this, the most commonly used Python interpreter (CPython) uses the [Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)](http://www.dabeaz.com/python/UnderstandingGIL.pdf) to ensure that only a *single* thread is operating in a Python program any one time, and switches between multiple threads to give the illusion of parallelism. The take-home message is that you can use threads for parallel tasks that are are slow because of latency (e.g. network request), but should use processes for parallel tasks that are compute-intensive (e.g. mathematical calculations)."
